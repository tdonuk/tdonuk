### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer who loves to code. In my spare time I develop side projects for different purposes and sometimes contribute to other's repositories. This allows me to not forget what I know and to learn new things by constant practice. I also share my work on this GitHub profile for others to benefit from.
